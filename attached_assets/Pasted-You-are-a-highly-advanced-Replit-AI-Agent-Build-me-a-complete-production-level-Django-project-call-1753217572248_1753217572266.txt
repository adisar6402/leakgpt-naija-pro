You are a highly advanced Replit AI Agent. Build me a complete, production-level Django project called **LeakGPT Naija Pro**.

🛡️ **App Description:**
An anonymous whistleblower and fraud detection platform. Users can upload `.txt` or `.pdf` documents for AI analysis to detect corruption or fraud signals. It also allows the public to report scam messages, suspicious URLs, or phone numbers. An admin dashboard tracks uploads, generates summaries, flags scam trends, and exports reports.

📦 **Required Features:**

1. ✅ **Frontend:**
   - Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive UI
   - Home page with overview of platform purpose
   - Upload form for `.txt` and `.pdf` files
   - Separate form to submit scam messages (text, URL, or number)
   - Results page to display flagged content and summary
   - Simple contact form

2. 🧠 **Backend Logic:**
   - Django views to handle file and form uploads
   - File reader that extracts text from `.txt` and `.pdf` files
   - AI analysis module (mock AI logic that detects corruption keywords like “kickback”, “embezzlement”, “419”, etc.)
   - Scam reporting logic that checks patterns (e.g. fake loan, phishing links)
   - Save results in database with timestamp and tags

3. 📊 **Admin Dashboard:**
   - View all document analysis history
   - View all scam reports
   - Filters by date, type, keyword match
   - Export to CSV or PDF
   - Stats: Most common keywords, number of reports, scam trends

4. 📂 **Extra:**
   - PDF summary download option for analyzed files
   - Optional anonymous mode (no login required)
   - Secure file handling
   - Django admin interface enabled for superusers

📁 **Folder Structure:**
- leakgpt_ai/ (Django app)
  - views.py
  - models.py
  - templates/
  - static/
  - ai_logic.py (mock AI keyword analysis)
- manage.py
- templates/
- README.md (with instructions)

🧪 **Testing:**
- Include 2-3 sample documents for demo
- Include fake scam submissions for preview
- Show result summaries and flagged phrases in red

🚀 **Final Output:**
A fully working Django project with complete frontend + backend logic, AI mock analysis, scam report tracking, and admin control — ready to deploy or extend.
